how to create a reusable buffer in java

some drawbacks that byte[] or java.nio.ByteBuffer have

byte[] does not support basic methods required for a buffer, for instance:
    startsWith
    endsWith
    compareTo
    equals (although Arrays.equals can help)

java.nio.ByteBuffer is not handy to use, it has its inner working logic exposed to its api

cur capacity mark reset etc

does not provide methods listed above

something like memcmp in c is needed here.
comparison to part of a buffer may also be necessary.
